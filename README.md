#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The problem that needed to be solved in this project, was entering a market of thermostats that could reach almost 9 billion dollars by 2026.  We were challenged to create a smart thermostat using the TI board recommended that could send data to SysTec server software over WiFi.  So we sought to develop a prototype.  

#What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was keeping my code as clean as possible.  Throughout each milestone, we learned three different peripherals that would eventually all work with one another to give the thermostat functionality.  We began by developing each peripheral seperately and ultimately joining all 3 in the final submission.  Each has their own unique code.  In order to keep it from overlapping or being to cluttered, commenting and keeping the code organized was what I tried maintaining throughout the entire code.  

#Where could you improve?
Where I could improve, is by learning improving developing a task scheduler for these projects.  These are my weaknesses when developing code.  Even with it comes to writing pseudocode it just doesn't make sense in adding an additional diagram. 

#What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Well we have now added the Code Composer studio to our list of IDEs we can work with.  This will be added to my different resources I can access whether to develop code or use for other projects.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The ability to understand the OOP is becoming very more important to me as I progress in learning how to code.  Here when we began the final project, using the header files allowed us to encapsulate code that for one, I most likely would have not been able to develop, be used within the code I was using to allow certain features.  The main point was that I could include the code needed without having to mess with it if I didn't know what to do with it.  This happens more often in each class that I take and more projects that I complete.   

#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One of the biggest ways we needed to make this project readable and maintainable was by adding in-line comments to each piece of code I developed.  Breaking down the code into smaller reusable functions and methods allows for the reusability of the code if any other part of it is not needed.  For example, we used three different functionalities.  Say you didn't need UART, you only needed the UART part of the code, you could still use it without the other two.
